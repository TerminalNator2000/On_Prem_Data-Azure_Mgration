# On_Prem_Data-Azure_Mgration

SQL Database Migration to Azure Cloud
Prepare the Environment

Assess your on-premises database for compatibility with Azure SQL.
Install Azure Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to identify potential issues.
Install Azure Data Migration Service (DMS) to assist in the migration process.
Create an Azure SQL Database

Sign in to the Azure Portal.
Create an Azure SQL Database and configure the necessary resources (server, region, pricing tier).
Set up SQL Server Authentication for database access.
Back Up the Database

Take a full backup of the SQL database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Ensure that the backup is stored in an accessible location.
Migrate the Database

Use DMA to assess and fix any issues in the database schema.
Choose between online (minimal downtime) or offline migration:
Online Migration: Use Azure DMS to perform continuous replication and switch over to the Azure SQL database with minimal downtime.
Offline Migration: Restore the on-premises database backup directly into the Azure SQL Database using SSMS or Azure DMS.
Testing and Validation

Validate the database schema and data in Azure SQL using SSMS.
Run test queries to ensure data integrity.
Ensure that applications connecting to the database are pointed to the new Azure SQL Database.
Optimize the Database

Optimize performance using Azure Advisor and Query Performance Insight.
Adjust database settings (e.g., scaling or pricing tier) based on performance needs.
Monitor and Secure the Database

Set up Azure SQL Monitoring tools for tracking performance and alerts.
Ensure security by enabling Azure Defender and configuring firewalls and role-based access control (RBAC).
